![AdonisJS: ToDo App](https://github.com/amineo/adonisjs-todo/_blog-images/adonisjs-todo-notes.png)



## About
The purpose of creating this ToDo app was to get more comfortable with Node and the [Adonis framework](http://www.adonisjs.com). This isn't a walk-through on how to create a ToDo App, but rather the bits-and-pieces of Adonis that makeup the app.

## AdonisJs
If you haven't heard of Adonis before, it's a very nice MVC framework for Node that's heavily inspired by some of the most battle-tested frameworks like Rails, Django and Laravel. Be sure to checkout the official [AdonisJs repo](https://github.com/adonisjs/adonis-framework) and [Documentation](http://www.adonisjs.com/docs/3.2/overview).
